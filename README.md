# Board_game_review
In this project the goal is to predict the rating of board games (range from 0 to 10) given some features such as the users that played and rated the game, the duration of the game, number of players etc.
The data is taken from the Board Game Geek and is scraped and provided by user *Sean Beck ThaWeatherman* on Github.
